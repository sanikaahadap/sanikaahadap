### Hi, I am Sanika
🤖 They say I'm diving into AI and deep learning, but honestly, I'm just splashing around in the kiddie pool of tech. Maybe one day I'll actually understand what I'm doing!

🌌 Navigating the universe of algorithms? More like stumbling through a dark alley with a flashlight made of Python syntax. But hey, I'm trying!


🛠️ I know some stuff <br>
Python | React | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | TensorFlow | Keras | Flutter | Firebase | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Flask | Bootstrap

If you've got any tips or want to laugh at my coding struggles, hit me up! Maybe together we can stumble upon something cool!


🌟 Let's see how many errors we can generate together! ✨
