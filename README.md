### Hi, I am Sanika
🤖 They say I'm diving into AI and deep learning, but honestly, I'm just splashing around in the kiddie pool of tech. Maybe one day I'll actually understand what I'm doing!

🌌 Navigating the universe of algorithms? More like stumbling through a dark alley with a flashlight made of Python syntax. But hey, I'm trying!


🛠️ Wait, I know some stuff <br>
Python (kind of)  |  React (reacting to what, exactly?)  |  Pandas (not the cute, cuddly kind)  |  NumPy (sounds like a rapper's name)  |  Scikit-learn (still learning, emphasis on the "learn")  |  Matplotlib (I can draw some basic shapes)  |  TensorFlow (sounds intimidating)  |  Keras (not sure if it's a name or a brand of cereal)


If you've got any tips or want to laugh at my coding struggles, hit me up! Maybe together we can stumble upon something cool!


🌟 Let's see how many errors we can generate together! ✨
