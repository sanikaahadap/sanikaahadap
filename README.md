### Hi, I am Sanika
🤖 They say I'm diving into AI and deep learning, but honestly, I'm just splashing around in the kiddie pool of tech. Maybe one day I'll actually understand what I'm doing!

🌌 Navigating the universe of algorithms? More like stumbling through a dark alley with a flashlight made of Python syntax. But hey, I'm trying!
